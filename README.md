# 🤖 Meet C.O.R.I.  **[Cooperative Organizational Robotic Intelligence]**  

C.O.R.I. is a modular, ROS 2–based home assistant robot designed to automate household tasks like laundry sorting. This personal robotics R&D project lays the groundwork for real-world autonomy and home integration.

> _"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do my art and writing, not to do my art and writing so I can do my laundry and dishes."_

That’s why I built CORI. The goal isn’t just automation—it’s improving quality of life.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This initial phase includes:

1. **ROS 2 Workspace Setup**  
   - Install ROS 2  
   - Configure a `colcon` workspace  
   - Install dependencies

2. **Basic Robot Model & Simulation**  
   - Build a URDF of a mobile base with a camera  
   - Simulate in Gazebo Harmonic + RViz2

3. **Color-Based Laundry Sorting**  
   - ROS 2 node using OpenCV with HSV filtering  
   - Detect and classify laundry colors in simulation

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **ROS 2 Native**  
  Modular architecture built with ROS 2 for flexibility and scalability.

- **Gazebo Simulation**  
  Simulates a mobile robot with an RGB camera in Gazebo Harmonic and RViz2.

- **Color-Based Laundry Sorting**  
  Uses OpenCV (Python) and HSV filtering for real-time color classification.

- **Scalable Design**  
  Structured to support future modules for navigation, manipulation, and behavior planning.

## 🔮 Vision for the Future

Most household robots follow commands. **CORI adapts with you.**

Where others automate tasks, CORI forms a relationship, remembering, and collaborating. It doesn't just act; it listens, asks, and grows with you.

## Phase 1: Recognition ✅
**"Teaching CORI to see"**

- Real-time object detection, color classification, and basic sorting logic
- Built in ROS 2 with a functioning Gazebo simulation pipeline
- **Result:** A fully working perception-to-action loop at 30 FPS

## Phase 2: Adaptation 🚧
**"Teaching CORI to learn with you"**

- Learns user preferences (e.g., blue shirt with white trim = wash separately)
- Engages in cooperative decision-making ("I think this is a dark—do you agree?")
- Remembers context, energy levels, time of day
- Handles uncertainty with confidence scores and natural-language explanations

## Phase 3: Human Cooperation 🤝
**"Teaching CORI to truly help"**

- Offers personalized meal prep advice based on stress or habits
- Suggests cleaning routines based on patterns, schedules, or moods
- Becomes a reliable partner across kitchen, laundry, home, and health
- Evolves from **tool → assistant → teammate**

## ❤️ Core Beliefs

- **Memory Engine:** Learns your routines, context, and corrections
- **Communication Layer:** Uses natural language and emotional cues to engage
- **Task Modules:** Kitchen, laundry, wellness, and household organization
- **Learning Core:** Cross-task adaptation, uncertainty handling, reinforcement over time

## 💫 Why It Matters

We don't need smarter assistants. **We need better teammates.**

CORI builds a relationship—not just a pipeline.

- Helps when you're overwhelmed
- Asks when it's unsure
- Remembers how you like things done
- Evolves to fit your life

This isn't about replacing people. **It's about building robots that understand us.**
