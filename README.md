# ü§ñ Meet C.O.R.I. 
**[Cooperative Organizational Robotic Intelligence]**  

C.O.R.I. is a modular, ROS 2‚Äìbased home assistant robot designed to automate household tasks like laundry sorting. This personal robotics R&D project lays the groundwork for real-world autonomy and home integration.

> _"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do my art and writing, not to do my art and writing so I can do my laundry and dishes."_

That‚Äôs exactly why I built CORI. 

This isn't about automating tasks‚Äîit's about reclaiming our time and energy by simplifying the same mundane tasks we've been doing by hand since the 60s. CORI is here to buy back time so we can focus on what truly matters. Instead of replacing human connection, CORI creates time for more of it. CORI's future will be centered around collaboration and adaptive behavior through behavioral modeling and pattern recongition, with the sole focus of improving quality of life. Right now CORI just sorts laundry, but soon, he will unload your groceries, take out your trash, and streamline the parts of your schedule, finally freeing up more of your time so you can focus on what's important to you.

## üîÆ Vision for the Future

Most household robots follow commands. **CORI adapts with you.**

Where others automate tasks, CORI forms a relationship, remembering, and collaborating. It doesn't just act; it listens, asks, and grows with you.

---

## Phase 1: Recognition ‚úÖ *(Completed on June 19th, 2025)*
**"Teaching CORI to see"**

- Real-time object detection, color classification, and basic sorting logic
- Built in ROS 2 with a functioning Gazebo simulation pipeline
- **Result:** A fully working perception-to-action loop at 30 FPS

---

## Phase 2: Adaptation üöß
**"Teaching CORI to learn with you"**

- Learns user preferences (e.g., blue shirt with white trim = wash separately)
- Engages in cooperative decision-making ("I think this is a dark‚Äîdo you agree?")
- Remembers context, energy levels, time of day
- Handles uncertainty with confidence scores and natural-language explanations

---

## Phase 3: Human Cooperation ü§ù
**"Teaching CORI to truly help"**

- Offers personalized meal prep advice based on stress or habits
- Suggests cleaning routines based on patterns, schedules, or moods
- Becomes a reliable partner across kitchen, laundry, home, and health
- Evolves from **tool ‚Üí assistant ‚Üí teammate**

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Core Beliefs

- **Memory Engine:** Learns your routines, context, and corrections
- **Communication Layer:** Uses natural language and emotional cues to engage
- **Task Modules:** Kitchen, laundry, wellness, and household organization
- **Learning Core:** Cross-task adaptation, uncertainty handling, reinforcement over time

## üí´ Why It Matters

We don't need smarter assistants. **We need better teammates.**

CORI builds a relationship‚Äînot just a pipeline.

- Helps when you're overwhelmed
- Asks when it's unsure
- Remembers how you like things done
- Evolves to fit your life

This isn't about replacing people. **It's about building robots that understand us.**
